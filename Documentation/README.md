Introduction to the BHR in Tech initiative
{% endembed %}

## The Initiative

The BHR in Tech (BiT) initiative aims to promote the adoption of the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP) in the Tech sector.\
\
The IO Foundation is committed to encourage and facilitate this implementation from a technical perspective to ensure the observance of the BHR Principles by design in line with the [DCDR advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

{% hint style="info" %}
As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the [Next Generation of Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen) and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting data. The [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.

### Objectives

The BHR in Tech initiative aims at encouraging a shift towards the adoption and implementation of the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP) in the Tech sector by

* designing and producing implementation guidelines and other research materials
* participating actively in the drafting of National Action Plans (NAPs) so that tech is considered as a thematic area or, to the very least, as a cross-cutting theme
* increase the recognition of the importance of technology in different jurisdictions through their National Action Plans
* reviewing existing National Action Plans (NAPs)&#x20;
* increase awareness and adoption across tech companies

### Mission

> To support governments with the necessary awareness and tools to codify the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP) for the tech sector in the National Action Plans (NAPs) and encourage tech companies towards early adoption even without applicable NAPs.

### Vision

> A world where
>
> * all governments have National Action Plans (NAPs) addressing technology as a thematic area, in accordance to their duty to protect
> * tech companies are designed and run around the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP), in accordance to their responsibility to respect
