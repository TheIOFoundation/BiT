Introduction to the BHR in Tech initiative
{% endembed %}

## The Initiative

The BHR in Tech (BiT) initiative aims to promote the adoption of the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUnited\_Nations\_Guiding\_Principles\_on\_Business\_and\_Human\_Rights) in the Tech sector.\
(See [full text document](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fdocuments%2Fpublications%2Fguidingprinciplesbusinesshr\_en.pdf))\
\
The IO Foundation is committed to encourage and facilitate this implementation from a technical perspective to ensure the observance of the BHR Principles by design.





Data-Centric Digital Rights (DCDR), an initiative from [The IO Foundation](https://tiof.click/TIOFWeb), is the advocacy by which it aims at protecting citizens' Rights by transparently implementing in their daily technology the regulations that should protect them.

TIOF views the technology as currently non-correlated with all working understandings and practices as to how any public-consumption industry functions traditionally where a clear separation is made between:

* Experts, who understand the complexities to design and build products that are compliant with applicable legislation and
* Citizens, who are solely tasked for being responsible users of the product

{% hint style="info" %}
As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the [Next Generation of Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen) and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting data. The [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.
{% endhint %}

In essence, DCDR is a framework for technologists composed by Principles, Taxonomies and other technical tools. It enables them to develop a deeper understanding about the nature of data, the digital twins that emerge from it and make possible for them to embrace their role as [NextGen Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen).

{% hint style="success" %}
By understanding that [_we are our data_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple1), technologists may architect Digital Spaces that aim at [_ending remedy_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple2) and build it so that they implement [_Rights by design_](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciple3).
{% endhint %}

### Objectives



#### **Summary of Activities**

* Design and produce recommendations and guidelines for the implementation of the UN GPs in the Tech sector
* Participate actively in the drafting of National Action Plans so that tech is considered as a thematic area or, to the very least, as a cross-cutting theme.

#### **Outcomes**

* Increase the recognition of the importance of technology in different jurisdictions through their National Action Plans
* Generate research material on the subject of BHR in the Tech sector





The DCDR initiative aims at encourage a shift in the current technology paradigms by providing

* [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples)
* [Sagan Oath](https://tiof.click/DCDRSaganOath)
* Generating the necessary body of work for
  * A [DCDR framework](https://tiof.click/DCDRFramework)
  * A set of taxonomies for
    * [Digital Harms](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalHarms)
    * [Digital Rights](https://tiof.click/DCDRDigitalRights)
    * [Use Cases](https://tiof.click/DCDRUseCases)
