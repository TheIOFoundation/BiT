Introduction to the BHR in Tech initiative
{% endembed %}

## The Initiative

The BHR in Tech (BiT) initiative aims to promote the adoption of the [United Nations' Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP) in the Tech sector.\
\
The IO Foundation is committed to encourage and facilitate this implementation from a technical perspective to ensure the observance of the BHR Principles by design in line with the [DCDR advocacy](https://tiof.click/DCDRAdvocacy).

{% hint style="info" %}
As core stakeholders, technologists play a critical role as the [Next Generation of Rights Defenders](https://tiof.click/TIOFNextGen) and need to orient themselves through new design and implementation paradigms focused on protecting data. The [DCDR Principles](https://tiof.click/DCDRPrinciples) put forward by The IO Foundation are concepts that help them navigate the intricacies of applying Human and Digital Rights in digital infrastructures, products and services.
