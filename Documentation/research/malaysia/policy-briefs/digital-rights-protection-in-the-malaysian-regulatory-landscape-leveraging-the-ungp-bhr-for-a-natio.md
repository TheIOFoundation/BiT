## Executive summary

This Policy Brief consolidates the proposed recommendations from The IO Foundation (TIOF), a Tech NGO advocating for Data-Centric Digital Rights, to incorporate technology as a cross-cutting issue in the upcoming National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights in Malaysia in its first iteration.

It is the result of 4 years of advocacy, research and engagement on BHR in the Tech sector in Malaysia and is unique in the sense that it is a document written from the perspective of technologists. Since its inception, TIOF has identified that the most significant gap in (Data-Centric) Digital Rights advocacy is the perspective from the builders and developers of these technologies â€” the technologists.

While it was the wish of The IO Foundation for this initial iteration of the NAP to develop a full thematic area on Technology, which has been the focus of TIOFâ€™s efforts, we encourage the Malaysian government and working parties to, at least, incorporate Technology as a cross-cutting issue. That is, as a subject that can be identified in all considered thematic areas as the source of challenges that can be remediated through the UNGPs.

This Policy Brief builds on the work of policy documents and toolkits that have been developed before by various policy professionals. While the United Nation Guiding Principle on Business and Human Rights apply to all business sectors, this document focuses on the technology business in particular. Due to the niche scope of this topic within the Business and Human Rights space, it is perhaps easier to understand this brief as an effort for mainstreaming (Data-Centric) Digital Rights into all areas of public policy as part of the Information and Communications Technology sectorâ€™s duty of care for digital citizens.

The stakeholders for this Policy Brief are as follows:
