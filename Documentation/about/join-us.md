## Introduction

The IO Foundation is always looking for talented individuals wishing to make an impact in technology through its BHR in Tech (BiT) initiative.

Do you have a passion towards the development and support of bringing the [United Nations Guiding Principles in Business and Human Rights](https://tiof.click/BITUNGP) into the Tech sector?

## How can I contribute?

Contributing in the BHR in Tech advocacy is easy!

There are 2 ways to proceed:

### Participate as a TIOF Member

By joining as a TIOF Member you will officially join one of the BiT Teams, participate in organized tasks and have access to tools and other resources as well as training.

TIOF Members can be:

**Commitment means staying loyal to what you said you were going to do long after the mood you said it in has left you.**
